      "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00233-y",
      "summary": "Enantioselectivity prediction in asymmetric catalysis has been a long-standing challenge in synthetic chemistry because of the high-dimensional nature of the structure–enantioselectivity relationship. A lack of understanding of the synthetic space results in laborious and time-consuming efforts in the discovery of asymmetric reactions, even if the same transformation has already been optimized on model substrates. Here we present a data-driven workflow to achieve a holistic enantioselectivity prediction of asymmetric pallada-electrocatalysed C–H activation by implementing transition state knowledge in machine learning. The vectorization of transition state knowledge allowed for an excellent description and extrapolation of the machine learning model, and enabled the quantitative evaluation of 846,720 possibilities. Model interpretation revealed the non-intuitive olefin effect on the enantioselectivity determination. Subsequent density functional theory calculations unravelled mechanistic knowledge that the rate-determining step depends on the olefin reactivity in the insertion step. Therefore, the olefin insertion step can be involved in the overall enantioselectivity determination. These results highlight the complementary features of knowledge-based machine learning with an interpretation-driven mechanistic study, which provides the opportunity to harness widely existing catalysis screening data and transition state models in molecular synthesis."

      "url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202106880",
      "summary": "Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most powerful asymmetric transformations in molecular synthesis. Although several privileged catalyst scaffolds are available, the catalyst development for asymmetric hydrogenation is still a time- and resource-consuming process due to the lack of predictive catalyst design strategy. Targeting the data-driven design of asymmetric catalysis, we herein report the development of a standardized database that contains the detailed information of over 12000 literature asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins. This database provides a valuable platform for the machine learning applications in asymmetric catalysis. Based on this database, we developed a hierarchical learning approach to achieve predictive machine leaning model using only dozens of enantioselectivity data with the target olefin, which offers a useful solution for the few-shot learning problem and will facilitate the reaction optimization with new olefin substrate in catalysis screening."

      "summary": "Description of molecular stereostructure is critical for the machine learning prediction of asymmetric catalysis. Herein we report a spherical projection descriptor of molecular stereostructure (SPMS), which allows precise representation of the molecular van der Waals (vdW) surface. The key features of SPMS descriptor are presented using the examples of chiral phosphoric acid, and the machine learning application is demonstrated in Denmark’s dataset of asymmetric thiol addition to N-acylimines. In addition, SPMS descriptor also offers a color-coded diagram that provides straightforward chemical interpretation of the steric environment."
