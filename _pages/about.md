I am a Young Researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science (SAIS), where I develop deep learning models for chemical reaction prediction as part of the Physical Science team. I earned my Ph.D. from Zhejiang University in 2024, with my doctoral dissertation titled 'Mechanism-Informed Data-Driven Prediction of Reaction Enantioselectivity', which applied AI approaches to build structure-enantioselectivity relationships.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
