I am a Researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science (SAIS), where I develop deep learning models for chemical reaction prediction as part of the Physical Science team. I earned my Ph.D. from Zhejiang University in 2024, with my doctoral dissertation titled 'Mechanism-Informed Data-Driven Prediction of Reaction Enantioselectivity', which applied AI approaches to build structure-enantioselectivity relationships.
