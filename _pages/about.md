Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Research Scientist at the Physical Science Team of the Shanghai Academy of Artificial Intelligence for Science ([SAIS](https://www.sais.com.cn/)). My research focuses on the intersection of chemistry and artificial intelligence, specifically developing â€‹â€‹data-driven modelsâ€‹â€‹ to predict chemical reaction.

I earned my Ph.D. from Zhejiang University in 2024 under the supervision of Prof. [Xin Hong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Cj1t08AAAAJ), where my dissertation â€‹â€‹integrated machine learning with chemical mechanismsâ€‹â€‹ to establish structure-enantioselectivity relationships for asymmetric synthesis. Earlier, I received my B.S. in Applied Chemistry from East China University of Science and Technology (2019).
